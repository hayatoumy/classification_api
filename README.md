A faithful butler, who reads the news everyday for you and selects which topics he knows you will be more intereste in. That would be really nice, ha? 
<br /> If you're like me, can't afford one, you need an algorithm that does that for you. For this one, I've got you.


Say, you're a journalist who writes for a nutrition magazine, a nutritionist, a committed person to healthy eating, or simply a nutrition enthusiast. You follow nutrition posts, but online there's a ton of other posts about cooking that you don't care about; you really would love to separate the two so you don't end up skimming through many posts that you are not interested in. 


For that, I have tested out several natural langauge processing models to classify which post falls into which category: cooking, or nutrition. 



I have reached an excellent model, with accuracy 98%. 
<br /> So you can rest assured that almost all of the posts are being classified correctly!
